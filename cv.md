##About me
My goal is to find a job by specialization in recent one-two years. I suppose, that combining work and study i can learn some 
new frameworks and reach middle-level for three years.  I am studing at BSU for two years so i want to have a practi—Åe in programming 
languages, which i know at a low level and which i will have to deal with. I mean java and java-based languages. I began project of 
android application last month, so my goal today is to learn something new in this sphere. However, it's unreal at the university,
that's why i hope to find necessary knowledge on this cource (EPAM|Android development).
